## <img style="display:inline" src="icon.jpg" width="50"/> Haku33 
* Perform a Hard Reset of the switch, and leave it as if it had just left the box

## Reason
* In case you don't have a clean copy of the nand, clean it and start using all original or use emunand

## Disclaimer
* It is advisable to make a backup before using it, since despite being well tested, failures can occur.
* I am not responsable of bricks, melted switch, nuclear explotions or full aniquilation
* The premise is elimination. Can it be the lack of information that makes you get banned? So far the case has not happened.
* It is true that it is not 100% safe, but the people who have tested it have not  been banned yet [Reference](https://youtu.be/9jV8iN7LJPY?list=PLNawpCFHdbXY-ZgF43vEJBk2IoweJfAlm)
* Haku33 is a simplification of this [method of clean](https://youtu.be/9jV8iN7LJPY?list=PLNawpCFHdbXY-ZgF43vEJBk2IoweJfAlm) 
* If you have a clean backup of the Nand, it is better use that,

* If your console is Banned there is nothing to do
* This will completely clean your switch, so you will lose everything

## Ipatched(Mariko) Are supported but used under your own risk.
Mariko consoles cannot reboot to the payload , so to load the payload Haku33 have to Overwrite some files on sd
* Haku33 Support Mariko in part and not suport clean emummc
* * I don't have a Mariko console to test, be sure of report any bug
* * if get a black screen, Press power like 3 times to make the console Wipe an boot

### Note:
Keep in mind that this program will not UNBAN you, or will it make you immune to BAN.
You will have a console as just out of the box, that's it.
So you can go online as long as you keep the console clean of cfw.
* * I recommend always have a backup of the nand for security reasons.
